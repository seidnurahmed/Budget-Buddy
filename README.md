# Budget Buddy

### Project Overview

Budget Buddy is a modern, full-stack financial management web application. It is designed to demonstrate proficiency in connecting a dynamic frontend with a robust backend and integrating with a third-party API for real-time financial data.

The application allows users to securely link their bank accounts and view their transaction history, providing a foundation for future features such as budgeting and spending analysis.

### Technical Highlights

* **Full-Stack Development:** Built using a modern MERN-like stack with a **Node.js/Express** backend and a responsive **React.js** frontend.

* **Plaid API Integration:** Implemented the complete **Plaid Link** authentication flow to securely connect to financial institutions and retrieve real-time transaction data.

* **Database Management:** Utilized **PostgreSQL** to create a persistent and scalable database for storing user data, including encrypted Plaid access tokens and transaction history.

* **Secure API Design:** Developed a RESTful API that handles the exchange of sensitive Plaid tokens, demonstrating an understanding of secure data handling practices.
